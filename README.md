# automate-spotify-playlists
Spotify uses sophisticated machine learning algorithms to generate Discover Weekly playlists for users. These Discover Weekly playlists consist of new songs for the listener and is curated based on the user's listening history. This project can not truly replicate or beat Spotify's methods of music curation due to the high complexity of their algorithms. The purpose of this project is to automate the curation of spotify playlist based on a user's top tracks (according to their last month's listening history). This is done through KMeans clustering, a method to group n variables into k clusters. Each observation belong to a cluster with the closest mean.
